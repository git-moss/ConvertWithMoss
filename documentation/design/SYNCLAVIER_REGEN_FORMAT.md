# Synclavier Regen library / timbre / SFLC format

This document describes the file format used by the **Synclavier Regen** (2023), reverse-engineered
from the device firmware (`SynclavierRegen.update`, a squashfs image containing the ARM64 application
`SynclavierIIDesktopRelease`) and the freely available libraries on <https://www.synclavier.com/regen-downloads/>.
It is the basis of the `de.mossgrabers.convertwithmoss.format.synclavier` detector and creator.

The format is not officially documented. All of the following was recovered by analysis; where a value
could not be pinned down with certainty it is called out.

## 1. Library folder

Sounds are organized in **libraries**. A library is a folder placed under `Libraries/` on the device SD
card and contains:

* one or more **timbres**, each a UTF-8 text file named `NN-Entry.txt` (see §3),
* the referenced **samples** (`.sflc`, or plain `.wav`/`.flac` in user libraries),
* `_<LibraryName>.tsv` — the sample index (§5),
* `_TimbreIndex.tsv` — the timbre index (§5),
* optional `Description.txt`, `Tier.txt`, cover image, and a `Session/` / `Studios/` / `Reverbs/` tree.

The `NN` in the timbre file name is derived from the zero-based bank entry index `be`:

```
NN = 10 * (be / 8 + 1) + be % 8 + 1        (integer arithmetic)
```

so entry 0 → `11-Entry.txt`, entry 7 → `18-Entry.txt`, entry 8 → `21-Entry.txt`, … This matches every
library with zero exceptions.

## 2. SFLC sample obfuscation

A `.sflc` file is a **standard FLAC file whose bytes are XORed with a key-stream**. The key-stream is
produced by a full-period (2^64) linear congruential generator (LCG) seeded from the file's *base name*
(the file name without its extension). Because the transformation is a plain XOR, the same routine both
obfuscates and de-obfuscates. The whole file is high-entropy with no header — there is no `fLaC` magic
until it is de-obfuscated.

```
A    = 0x3357C6A7C5DCC7F5     # LCG multiplier (A % 4 == 1)
C    = 0x8D14B6503262BD01     # LCG increment (odd)  -> full period 2^64
SEED = 0xAEAEE9B5E0E46745     # seed base
name = base file name without extension, as UTF-8 bytes   # e.g. "Prodigy Long Sync"

# seed derivation
state = SEED
for b in name:
    state = ((b ^ state) * A + C) mod 2^64

# key-stream and XOR (encrypt == decrypt)
for i, byte in enumerate(file_bytes):
    state = (state * A + C) mod 2^64
    plain[i] = byte ^ (state & 0xFF)
```

In the firmware the three 64-bit constants are obfuscated as arrays of eight 32-bit floats, each a
perfect square; `floor(sqrt(f))` of the eight floats gives the eight little-endian bytes of the constant
(transform function at file offset `0x8e7cf0`; seed derivation and read/XOR loop in the
`SFLCFileInputStream` constructor at `0x37c1f0` and its read method at `0x388220`). All 71 sample files
from the firmware libraries and the *Starsky's Prodigy* bank de-obfuscate to a FLAC stream that passes
`flac -t`.

**Consequence for writing:** the key depends on the output file's base name, so renaming a `.sflc` file
corrupts it. The creator therefore obfuscates with the exact name it writes the file under.

User libraries may reference plain, un-obfuscated `.wav` or `.flac` files instead (e.g. the
`ExampleUserCardContents` download). Both are read.

## 3. Timbre text file

UTF-8 with LF line endings:

```
Line 1: title (display name)
Line 2: comment (may be empty; the paragraph separator is "¶" U+00B6; "#tags" are searchable)
Line 3: SynclavierVirtualInstrumentTimbreVersion000 <gen> 12 24 <mask> 99 <n>
Line 4+: one self-contained parameter line each
```

The version header fields: `<gen>` is the writer generation (5/6/7), `12` the number of partial slots,
`24` the maximum number of harmonics, `<mask>` a capability mask of the form `(2^k - 1) & ~32`, `99` the
maximum timbre-frame index and `<n>` a writer counter. Only `<gen>` is informative for parsing; the
creator writes a safe modern header `7 12 24 4063 99 14`.

### 3.1 Line grammar

```
Synclavier<Keyword> <a> <b> <c> <payload...>
```

The three leading integers are index fields whose meaning depends on the keyword prefix:

* `TBPI*` — timbre-global, `a=b=c=0`.
* `PTPI*` — per partial, `a` = partial index (0..11).
* `EMPI*` — per modulation slot, `a` = slot (0..11).
* `MIDICCValue` — `c` = MIDI CC number.

Parameter lines are written only when *touched* in the editor (a dirty flag, not "non-default"), so a
robust reader must not rely on any particular line being present.

### 3.2 Partials

A timbre has up to twelve partials (layers). Each partial has a synth mode (`SynclavierPTPISynthMode`):
`0` additive/FM, `1` subtractive, `2` sample playback, `4` frame-resynthesis of a sample. A partial is
marked *active* by the presence of a `SynclavierPTPIVolume` line; the `timbrePartials` bit-mask in
`_TimbreIndex.tsv` is exactly the set of partials that carry a volume line.

The patch list entries of a *muted* partial stay in the file (the editor keeps them, so the partial can
be switched back on), but the device does not play them. The reader therefore converts only the partials
with a volume line and skips a timbre without any with a note. The 32 timbres of the *Starsky's Prodigy*
bank confirm the rule without exception, e.g. *Prodigy Pad* holds entries for three partials but a mask
of `6`: its first partial, a sub-octave pulse, is muted - and *Elec Piano* has entries for partials 0, 1,
4 and 5 with a mask of `51`.

### 3.3 Patch list entry (the sample zones)

Each `SynclavierPTPatchListEntry` maps one sample into one partial. **All zone data must be read from
these lines only** — the sibling `SynclavierPTPIFile*` scalar lines merely mirror the patch line that is
currently selected in the editor and are frequently stale.

```
SynclavierPTPatchListEntry <partial> <entry> <lowKey> <highKey> <rootKey> \
    <volFrac> <tuneFrac> <start> <end> <loopStart> <loopEnd> <loopBits> <0> \
    <channels> <frames> <rateHz> <path...>
```

| Field       | Meaning                                                                    |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| partial     | partial (layer) index                                                      |
| entry       | entry index within the partial                                             |
| lowKey/highKey/rootKey | MIDI key range and the sample's original key                    |
| volFrac     | volume as a fraction (0.5 neutral): `gain[dB] = 36 * volFrac - 12`          |
| tuneFrac    | tuning as a fraction (0.5 centered): `tune[cents] = 250 * tuneFrac - 125`   |
| start / end | play start/end as a fraction of `frames`                                   |
| loopStart / loopEnd | loop start/end as a fraction of `frames`                           |
| loopBits    | 0 = no loop, 1 = loop, 3 = loop + cross-fade, 4 = one-shot, 5 = one-shot + loop |
| channels    | 1 = mono, 2 = stereo                                                        |
| frames      | number of sample frames (used to turn the fractions into frame positions)  |
| rateHz      | sample rate                                                                |
| path        | referenced sample (see §6); may carry a virtual folder prefix and a placeholder extension |

The patch entry itself has no panning; panning is a **per-partial** setting (`PTPIPan`, see §4). Older
(`gen` 5/6) files write the integer fields as floats. Empty-path placeholder entries occur and are ignored.

## 4. Envelopes, filter and velocity layers

**Amplitude envelope** (per partial): `PTPIVEnvDelay / VEnvAttack / VEnvPeak / VEnvIDecay / VEnvSust /
VEnvFDecay` — a Synclavier Delay / Attack-to-Peak / Initial-Decay-to-Sustain / Final-Decay (= release)
envelope; times are in seconds (0..30), levels in percent. Converted to and from the zone amplitude
envelope.

**Panning** (per partial): `PTPIPan <partial> 0 0 <value>` where `value` is an integer in `[-63..63]`, `0`
centered. Present only when non-centered (the format omits default values). Mapped to the panning of all
the partial's zones (`panning = value / 63`); on writing, the average pan of a partial's zones is written
back as one `PTPIPan` line, and centered partials emit none.

**Per-partial gain and pitch**: on top of the per-patch-entry gain/tuning, a partial has its own gain and
a three-level pitch offset, all confirmed from the firmware parameter descriptor table and pitch engine
(`frequency = 440 · 2^(semitones / 12)`):
* `PTPIVolume` — a dB **attenuation** in `[-50..0]` (`0` = neutral, the common case). Added to the gain of
  every zone of the partial. On writing, because the patch-entry gain field only reaches down to `-12` dB,
  a deeper attenuation is split off into `PTPIVolume` and the per-zone remainder stays in the entry.
* `PTPITune` — a fine tuning in **cents** (`[-125..125]`).
* `PTPITran` — a coarse transpose in **semitones** (`[-24..24]`).
* `PTPIOctave` — a coarse octave transpose stored as a **reference frequency** in Hz where `440` (A4) is
  neutral; its contribution is `12 · log2(Hz / 440)` semitones (always whole octaves, `-72..+24`).
  Omitted ⇒ neutral (`440`).

  The three pitch terms add up: `extraSemitones = Tran + Tune/100 + 12·log2(Octave/440)`, applied to the
  tuning of every zone of the partial. On writing, whole semitones beyond the entry tuning field's `±125`
  cents are split off into `PTPITran` and the fine remainder stays in the entry (octave-sized offsets are
  written as `PTPITran` too, within its `±24` range).

**Note filter** (timbre-global): `TBPINoteFilterType` is a multi-mode selector encoded as `index / 255`,
where `index` is `1 = LP12, 2 = HP12, 3 = BP12, 4 = LP24, 5 = HP24, 6 = BP24` — the low three are 2-pole,
the high three 4-pole, and `1/4` = low-pass, `2/5` = high-pass, `3/6` = band-pass (verified against the
production 1.18 firmware). `TBPINoteFilterCutoff` (0..1 fraction), `TBPINoteFilterResonance` (0..1), `TBPINoteFilterPitchTrack`
(keyboard tracking, `1` = one octave per octave) and the filter envelope: the times
`TBPINoteFilterAttack / Decay / Release` (seconds) and the contour levels `TBPINoteFilterStartDelta`,
`TBPINoteFilterPeakDelta` and `TBPINoteFilterDecayDelta`, all in **octaves relative to the cutoff**. The
Regen manual ('Filter Envelope') names the four levels of the contour Start, Peak, Sustain and End: a note
starts at the start level, reaches the peak level at the end of the attack, decays to the sustain level -
which *is* the Cut Off parameter, i.e. delta `0` - and after the key release heads to the end level within
the release time ("a note can start ... an octave lower than the Sustain Level ... by setting the Start
Level to -1"). `DecayDelta` is the end level: 'decay' is the classic Synclavier name of the final decay,
the release. Untouched levels are `0`.

The model envelope is unipolar (levels 0..1 scaled by a signed depth, 10 octaves = full depth), while a
contour may lie on both sides of the cutoff - the *Starsky's Prodigy* pads start at `+0.4`, peak at `+2.2`
and release to `-1.4`. The reader therefore moves the filter cutoff to the lowest point of the contour
(`cutoff · 2^floor`) and measures the levels from there: for *Prodigy Pad* the cutoff becomes
`2612 Hz · 2^-1.4 = 990 Hz`, the depth `3.6` octaves, the start level `50 %`, the peak `100 %`, the sustain
`39 %` and the end level `0 %`, so a destination sustains at 2612 Hz and closes to 990 Hz on release. When
the attack sweeps downwards (the peak is the lowest point) the cutoff is moved to the highest point
instead and the depth is negative, so the peak is always the full level. With an instant attack the start
level has no effect and is replaced by the peak. The writer inverts this: the Regen cutoff is the model
cutoff moved up by `span · sustain`, and the three deltas are `span · (level - sustain)`.

Converted as a low-pass, high-pass or band-pass filter (with the matching 2- or 4-pole slope) with its
cutoff envelope. The filter is set both per zone and as the global filter of the multi-sample.

**Velocity layers**: the Synclavier has no per-zone velocity field. Instead each partial has a crossfade
window `PTPIXFStart / XFIn / XFOut / XFEnd` along a *dynamic axis* whose source is `TBPIDynEnvSrc` (`10` =
velocity, `16` = mod-wheel, `7` = …). When the source is velocity, each partial is a velocity layer:
`velLow = XFStart`, `velHigh = XFEnd`, with `XFIn`/`XFOut` the cross-fade edges. On writing, a source with
velocity layers sets `TBPIDynEnvSrc 0 0 0 10` and one partial per layer with the window from the layer's
velocity range. A timbre has 12 partials, hence at most 12 velocity layers.

Not converted: the `IEnv*` FM/index envelope, the `PTCarrier`/`ModulatorCoeffs`/`Phases` harmonic data,
the frame partials and the `EMPISource`/`EMPIDest` modulation matrix (whose numeric destination ids shift
between firmware generations — the trailing symbolic name such as `SynclavierEDFilterCutoff` is the stable
identifier). These are additive/FM-synthesis specifics that do not map to a generic multi-sample.

## 5. Index files

`_<LibraryName>.tsv` (sample index), tab-separated, one header row then one row per sample:

```
mFilenameNoExt  mTitle  mComment  mSampleRate  mFrameLength  mChannels  mMIDIKey  mFileHz \
    mPitchTrack  mMarkStart  mTotalLen  mLoopLen  mLoopXfade  mLoopBits  mMedia  mExtension  mDLMLSB
```

`_TimbreIndex.tsv` (timbre index):

```
bankEntry  timbreName  timbreInfo  timbrePartials  timbreDLMLSB
```

`bankEntry` is the zero-based entry index (see §1 for the file-name mapping), `timbreInfo` is the comment,
`timbrePartials` the active-partial bit-mask (§3.2).

## 6. Sample resolution

The `path` in a patch entry may contain a virtual folder prefix and a placeholder extension. To find the
actual file the reader uses the *base name* of the path and looks in the timbre's folder for, in order:
the exact referenced name (plain user samples), then `<base>.sflc`, `<base>.flac`, `<base>.wav`,
`<base>.aif(f)`. Names truncated with a trailing `~` and alternative extensions are resolved through the
`_<LibraryName>.tsv` sample index.

## 7. Mapping to the ConvertWithMoss model

* library folder → a set of multi-samples (each timbre is one `IMultisampleSource`);
* active partial (§3.2) → `IGroup` (layer); patch entry → `ISampleZone`; muted partials are skipped;
* `lowKey`/`highKey`/`rootKey` → zone key range and root key;
* `volFrac` → zone gain (dB, via the law above); `tuneFrac` → zone tuning (semitones);
* per-partial `PTPIVolume` (dB) adds to the zone gain; per-partial `PTPITune` (cents) + `PTPITran`
  (semitones) + `PTPIOctave` (`12·log2(Hz/440)` semitones) add to the zone tuning (§4); on writing these
  carry the part of the gain/tuning that does not fit the per-zone entry fields;
* `start`/`end` fraction × `frames` → zone start/stop; `loopBits` 1/3/5 → a forward loop with
  `loopStart`/`loopEnd` fraction × `frames`;
* per-partial `VEnv*` → the zone amplitude envelope; per-partial `PTPIPan` → the zones' panning
  (`panning = value / 63`); timbre-global `NoteFilter*` → a low-pass, high-pass or band-pass filter with
  a 2- or 4-pole slope (per zone and as the global filter) with its cutoff envelope, whose contour levels
  are re-based onto the unipolar model envelope (§4);
* when `TBPIDynEnvSrc == 10`, each partial's `XF*` window → the zones' velocity range (velocity layers);
  on writing, groups (velocity layers) → partials with `XF*` windows, capped at 12 partials;
* `#tags` in the comment ↔ category and keywords: on reading, the first tag becomes the category and
  the remaining tags the keywords; on writing, the category is emitted first as the Regen category tag
  (mapped to the canonical category list of the Regen manual §3.2, e.g. `Bass` → `#bass`,
  `Chromatic Percussion` → `#chime`; categories with no equivalent fall back to the sanitized name) and
  the keywords follow as property tags (all lower-cased, single-token, de-duplicated). The containing
  folder name → creator.

On writing, the laws are inverted (`volFrac = (dB + 12) / 36`, `tuneFrac = (cents + 125) / 250`), the full
sample is FLAC-encoded and then obfuscated into a `.sflc` file named after the (sanitized) sample name,
and the two index files are generated.
